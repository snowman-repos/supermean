# Supermean

This is the beginnings of a yeoman generator for scaffolding MEAN stack apps: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS.

Unlike other similar generators, this will be more opinionated without many configuration options. 

## Features:

* Express server integrated with gulp tasks and RESTful API
* Scaffolding for server API
* Livereload of client and server files
* Jade, Stylus, CoffeeScript development stack
* Raw code - no dependencies on common frameworks like Bootstrap or libraries like jQuery
* Easy deployment workflow with heroku deployment scaffolding
* MongoDB integration
* Optional Passport integration for adding user accounts
